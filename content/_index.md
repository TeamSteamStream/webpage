Team stream stream is a CTF team at Uppsala university.

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are IT-security competitions
where the competitors face problems related to web security, cryptography,
reverse engineering and binary exploitation. The best defense against
the Dark Arts is to know how they work! Read more [here](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).

The team members usually meet monday evenings ~~at Ångström to learn new concepts and solve problems together.~~
**Due to the COVID-19 situation, we have virtual online meetings every monday at 18:30.**
We often participate in CTF competitions.
If you are intrested to know more and/or join, contact <lars.haulin@gmail.com>.

This webpage is sometimes (when someone in the team feels ambitious)
updated with posts about what we have gone through on our meetings.
