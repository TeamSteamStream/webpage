Team stream stream is a CTF team at Uppsala university.
CTF competitions are described here: <https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/>

We usually meet monday evenings at Ångström to learn new concepts and solve problems together.
Sometimes we also participate in CTF competitions.
If you are intrested to know more and/or join our slack group, contact <lars.haulin@gmail.com>.

This webpage is sometimes (when someone in the team feels ambitious)
updated with posts about what we have gone through on our meetings.
