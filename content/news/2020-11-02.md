The COVID situation has stopped us from having the regular face to face meetings,
but we still have weekly meetings online.

First we started out with meetings using [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si),
but we have now moved on to Discord.
The Discord channel has mostly replaced the old Slack channel.

## CTF participation during 2020

During 2020 we have so far participated in about 30 CTFs,
and regularly placed in the top 100's on the
[scoreboard at CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/109722).

Among the biggest events during the year was when
we teamed up with eight other nordic teams to compete
in the DefCon CTF finals as team [Norsecode](https://norsecode.team/).
A few of us went to Stockholm to compete together in our first attack-defense CTF.
